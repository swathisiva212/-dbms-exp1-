# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.

### Entities and Attributes

2.PersonalTrainingSession

SessionID (Primary Key)

Date

Time

Duration

3.Trainer

TrainerID (Primary Key)

Specialization

4.Payment

PaymentID (Primary Key)

5.Attendance 

Attendance

Status

### Relationships and Constraints

1.MembershipType - MemberProgram - Trainer
Relationship: MemberProgram
Cardinality: Many MembershipTypes to Many Trainers
Participation: Partial on both sides (not all members may have programs or trainers, and trainers may work with multiple members)

2.MembershipType - PersonalTrainingSession - Trainer
Relationship: PersonalTrainingSession
Cardinality: One MembershipType can have many PersonalTrainingSessions (1:N), and many sessions may be conducted by one Trainer (N:1)
Participation: Total on sessions (each session must link membership and trainer), partial on MembershipType and Trainer

3.PersonalTrainingSession - Attendance
Relationship: Attendance
Cardinality: One PersonalTrainingSession can have many Attendance records (1:N)
Participation: Total on Attendance (each attendance record must reference a session), partial on session

4.Trainer - Payment
Relationship: Trainer makes Payment
Cardinality: One Trainer may have multiple Payments (1:N)
Participation: Partial on both sides (trainers may or may not have payments, payments are linked to one trainer)

## Constraints:
1.MembershipType is uniquely identified by MemberID; Session by SessionID; Trainer by TrainerID; and Payment by PaymentID.

2.PersonalTrainingSession depends on MembershipType and Trainer (associative relationship).

3.Attendance tracks each member’s participation in training sessions with attributes like attendance date and status.

4.Payments are tied to trainers to record transactions such as fees received.


### Assumptions
Each member must have a unique membership type assigned.

Trainers specialize in specific areas and conduct personal
